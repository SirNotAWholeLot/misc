A test Django project. Work in progress, features will be added as I come up with them.
Added in a separate orphan branch to simplify uploads as my local folder structure doesn't match the repository whatsoever.

Current features:
- Roger Man: display a database entry through a link, create new db entries, display links automatically.
- Notes: display db entries of notes.
