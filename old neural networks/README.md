Here are some examples of my earlier neural network models:
- Probabilistic classification model using the freely available dataset of protein localization sites in E.coli bacteria; written in 2019 with only the basic Python modules
- Multilayer perceptron FBN using a dataset of Arthrospira platensis growth measurements in a photobioreactor; written in 2020 with the use of TensorFlow 1
