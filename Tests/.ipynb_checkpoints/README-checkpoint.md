A notebook containing various standalone small things and code written to test things.
This was written in env39-gpu, and parts of it rely on modules such as TensorFlow and multiprocessing which I didn't install in env312

- Roger Man test: using multiprocessing module to spawn a separate process and get a responce from it
- Some tests for Keras model maker when there was a memory leak somewhere, solving that through multiprocessing application
- Making non-preloading switchable layouts and a basic data graph plotter in PyQt
- Automating calling an inconvenient .exe on specific files recursively found in the current path
- Downloading a specific image from the Net and saving it with a timestamp
