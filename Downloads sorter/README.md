This is a small application I made to help move the contents of my downloads folder to archive while sorting them by extension, when downloads folder gets too full. Made in 2024.

Python (Jupyter notebook) version:
- GUI
- Allows saving a specified path to both the downloads folder and the destination
- The destination subfolder naming scheme is hardcoded
- Can be rolled into an .exe using pyinstaller for maximum portability

C version:
- Old version of the program made in 2015, provided as an example

C++ versions:
- Base: old version of the program made in 2020, provided as an example
- Non-unicode: an adjusted version I made after running into some issues handling non-lower-ASCII filenames in 2023, provided as an example
