Recent examplea of MLP FFBPNN of the kind that I used in my work.

Standalone version does not feature automated hyperparameter optimization or manual testing of a trained model, instead written to plot learning curves for a customizable singluar configuration.
The full version features grid search and random search hyperparameter optimization as well as plotters and some extra variations for testing.
