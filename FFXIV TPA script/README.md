This is an AHK script made in an attempt to make a tab-target MMORPG - Final Fantasy XIV - control more like a third-person action game.

Features:
- Mouse aim:
Locking onto things by looking at them and pressing C, somewhat similar to how lock-on works in Soulslikes, for example; interacting with a thing by looking at it and pressing R.
- Automated combo skill chaining:
Allows you to go further into chains of skills that are unlocked/empowered by previous skills (such as many DPS classes attack chains) by pressing the same button, or brancing into another line of skills with another,
using only one button per possible branch instead of requiring separate binds. This relies on a specific UI arrangement and a modifiled UI file to make a 'ready' combo skill border recognizeable by the script.
- Pausing script automatically when not needed:
Includes exceptions for chat, alt-tabbing, and temporarily calling up the cursor with LAlt when needed, similar to Black Desert Online, for example. For complex menuing it is recommended to pause the script manually.

Created in 2021 for personal use.
